# Active learning guided computational discovery of plant-based redoxmers for organic non-aqueous redox flow battery

*Supplementary Information*

*This repo consists of 2 folders: CSME, and Active Learning*

## CSME
- Contains the CSME code and it's input file

## Active Learning
- MBO_Flavone.ipynb has the Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization based active learning code implemented for the flavone library
- all_mbo_functions.py has utility functions for the MBO_Flavone.ipynb

- Feature Generation: This folder has Jupyter Notebooks to generate rdkit features from the SMILES, and feature reduction. Chemfunctions.py has utility functions for the feature generation and feature reduction.
